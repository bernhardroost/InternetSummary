## **Things You Cannot See or Touch**
The things you cannot see or touch are the concepts and ideas that have are used to develope how the devices in a network communicate. The internet is a global network which allows communication across the globe.

### **Binary**

Binary is a base in the number system containing only ones and zeros. Also known as base 2. It is used mainly to represent high and low, on and off, true and false. A sequence of the ones and zeros can be used to represent a message. Messages sent from an electronic device are made up of bits. A bit is either a one or a zero.

    4 bits = Nibble 

    8 bits = Byte

    16 bits = Half Word

    32 bits = Word

    64 bits = Double Word


### **Hexadecimal**
Base 16 is called hexadecimal and is made of 16 characters that each represent a numerical value. A hexadecimal value is mostly used to represent a nibble.

Example :
* A nibble with the value 0010 in binary is 0x2 in hex  
* A byte with the value 10000001 in binary is 0x81 in hex

|Decimal   |Hexadecimal| Binary|
|---------:|----------:|------:|
|0         |0          |0      |
|1         |1          |1      |
|2         |2          |10     |
|3         |3          |11     |
|4         |4          |100    |
|5         |5          |101    |
|6         |6          |110    |
|7         |7          |111    |
|8         |8          |1000   |
|9         |9          |1001   |
|10        |A          |1010   |
|11        |B          |1011   |
|12        |C          |1100   |
|13        |D          |1101   |
|14        |E          |1110   |
|15        |F          |1111   |
|          |           |       |

### **Transporting Bits**
* Electricity
* Light
* Radio Waves

### **Protocols**
Protocols are the rules and procedures used to establish a standard. The internet being a global collection of individual networks need standards so that everyone knows the rules that need to be followed so that messages can be sent between devices irrespective of the manufacturer or model.

* TCP/IP
  * Transfer Control Prototcol (TCP)
  * Internet Protocol (IP)
    * IPv4 : A 32 bit address that is typically represented using decimal.
    * IPv6 : A 128 bit address that is typically represented using hexadecimal.

* HTTP, HTTPS, SSL
* DNS
* IMAP and POP
    * Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
    * IMAP

## **Things You Can See or Touch**

### **Cables and Wires**
* Ethernet
* Fiber Optic : Uses light pulses to represent bits and traonsport messages between the sender and the receiver.
### **Devices**
* Modem
* Router
* Switch

## **Security**
In our lives we use locks, alarms, and surveillance to keep physical properties protected. Security is important because not everyone has good intentions.  
### **Cryptography**

### **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
 
#### **Certificate Authority (CA)**

### **Firewall**
The purpose of a firewall is to block unwanted bits from travelling in a specific direction. This means that it can prevent attackers from penetrating a private network. Firewalls can either be a software or a combination of hardware and software. They are used to protect individual computers or networks.
### **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
